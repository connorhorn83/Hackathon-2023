## Introducing Nutri*py*
Nutripy is a website that helps users be informed about the nutritional contents of their food and beverages. Ingredients are identified and quickly summarized, all from one picture of the barcode. Nutripy is a great tool for those who want to be more informed about what they are eating, and for those who want to make healthier choices.

## How it works
Nutripy is super simple! All you do is head over to the [Nutripy site](https://nutrify3.taipy.cloud) and upload a picture of a barcode. The site will then identify the barcode and return the nutritional information of the product, including the pros and cons of all the ingredients within that item.
