## Introducing Nutri*py*
Nutripy is a web application that helps to inform users about the nutritional contents of their food and beverages. Ingredients are identified and quickly summarized, all from one picture of the product's barcode. Nutripy is a great tool for those who want to be more informed about what they are eating, and for those who want to make healthier choices.
